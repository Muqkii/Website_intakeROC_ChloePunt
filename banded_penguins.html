    <h1>Banded Penguins</h1>

    <h2>Magellanic penguin</h2>
    <p>
        The Magellanic penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus) is a relatively small banded penguin that lives around the coastal areas of southern South America. It mostly lives in Patagonia and around the Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas), but you can sometimes see vagrants as far north as Brazil and as far south as Antarctica.

Of all the banded penguin species, the Magellanic penguins are easily the most populous. They generally travel in huge flocks and they form densely-packed colonies in bushes or borrows during the nesting season.

It can be very difficult to tell the Magellanic and Humboldt penguins apart, especially on the western coast of South America where their ranges overlap. However, there are two white bands of feathers around the neck of a Magellanic penguin while there's just one white band on the neck of a Humboldt penguin. This is one of the only ways to tell the species apart in the wild.

Conservation-wise, the IUCN lists the Magellanic penguin as a species of least concern. But the species' population numbers are declining mostly due to habitat loss, the effects of oil spills, infectious diseases, and climate change.

    <h2>Humboldt penguin</h2>
    <p>
        Found only on the Pacific Coast of South America, the Humboldt penguin (Spheniscus humboldti) is a medium-sized flightless bird that thrives in the cold waters of the Humboldt Current. It is closely related to the Magellanic penguin, but there are no breeding colonies of Humboldts located on the eastern coast of South America.

Humboldt penguins are skilled predators that feed on schools of pelagic fish. They prefer to eat Atlantic saury, Araucanian herring, silver-sided weedfish, and various anchovies. Most Humboldts forage near their colonies, however, they occasionally swim a few hundred miles from shore to search for food.

The Humboldt penguin faces a number of threats that are unique to its Pacific Coast habitat. In particular, El Niño-La Niña variations can have a major impact on Humboldt penguins. The suppression of the upwelling of nutrient-rich waters off the coast of South America during strong El Niños can cause a massive decrease in food availability for these penguins.

Humboldts also seem to be very sensitive to human presence. The introduction of invasive species, such as feral goats, can also destroy vegetation that these penguins use for nesting. As a result, the Humboldt penguin is currently listed as vulnerable by the IUCN.
