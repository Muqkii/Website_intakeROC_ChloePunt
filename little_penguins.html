    <h2>Little penguin</h2>
    <p>
        The world's smallest penguin, the appropriately named little penguin (Eudyptula minor) is a tiny flightless bird that lives in New Zealand and southern Australia.

Due to its slate-blue plumage color, the little penguin is sometimes called the blue penguin, particularly in New Zealand. Adult little penguins are normally no more than 13 inches (33 cm) tall and they usually weigh around 3.3 lbs (1.5 kg).

These penguins primarily live in small colonies in rocky and grassy areas where they can make nests. In sandy environments, the little penguin is known to burrow and dig a nest, too. In rare cases, these penguins will share their burrows and nests with other bird species.

Due to their small size, little penguins are hunted by a wide variety of predators, including various lizards, snakes, seals, and even Tasmanian devils. They were also hunted for sport during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Nowadays, the species is heavily protected in most regions and it is listed as a species of least concern.

    <h2>White-flippered penguin</h2>
    <p>
        The white-flippered penguin (Eudyptula albosignata) is a recently-identified penguin that's the subject of much dispute in the taxonomic community. It is very closely related to the little penguin and some taxonomists believe it to be a subspecies rather than a species in its own right.

Nevertheless, the white-flippered penguin features a distinct plumage coloration that's mostly gray, rather than blue. It also has a white stripe on both flippers, hence the name.

Although it shares a similar range with little penguins, the white-flippered penguin only nests on Motunau Island and the Banks Peninsula near the city of Christchurch on New Zealand’s South Island.

The white-flippered penguin is mostly nocturnal, making it one of the only penguin species that's mostly active at night. This makes the species difficult to observe in the wild, as they’re often burrowing in their nests when human researchers visit their colonies.
