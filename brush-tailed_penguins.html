    <h2>Adélie Penguin</h2>
    <p>
        Named after the wife of French sailor Jules Dumont d'Urville, Adèle, the Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) is the smallest of the three members of the genus Pygoscelis. Adélie penguins are the most widely distributed and the most southerly penguins on the planet.

The Adélie penguin boasts a characteristic all-black head, white stomach, and light pink feet, giving them a classic tuxedo look. Plus, these penguins have a distinct white ring around their eyes that makes it easy to distinguish them from their Antarctic neighbors.

As is the case with all Pygoscelis penguins, the Adélie feeds primarily on Antarctic krill, but they're also known to eat Antarctic silverfish and glacial squid. Their primary predators are leopard seals, though Adélie chicks and eggs are often eaten by south polar skuas.

Due to their wide distribution, Adélie penguins are listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN and their population numbers may actually be on the rise. However, they are still at risk in the long term due to overfishing and the effects of climate change.

    <h2>Chinstrap Penguin</h2>
    <p>
        Aptly named, the chinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarctica) is a small flightless bird with a distinctive black line of feathers under its chin that looks suspiciously like a chinstrap of a helmet. The chinstrap is found primarily in Antarctica, but there are breeding colonies located as far north as the Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas).

Like the other members of the Pygoscelis genus, the chinstrap forms large breeding colonies each year. They nest exclusively on rocky and sandy areas where they can build a circular nest out of small stones. Young chinstrap penguins are absolutely adorable and they look like little gray puffballs until they experience their first molt.

Chinstraps have a reputation for being boisterous and aggressive. They also make a characteristic noise that sounds surprisingly like a mix between a donkey braying and a squawking gull.
