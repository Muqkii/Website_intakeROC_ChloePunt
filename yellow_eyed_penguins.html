    <h2>Yellow eyed penguin</h2>
    <p>
        The sole recognized living species in the genus Megadyptes, the yellow-eyed penguin (Megadyptes antipodes) is a truly stunning bird that only lives in southeastern New Zealand. Until fairly recently, the yellow-eyed penguin was classified alongside the little penguins, but genetic analyses suggest that they aren't closely related.

Also known as the tarakaka or the hoiho, the yellow-eyed penguin lives in a number of small colonies on Stewart Island as well as the Auckland Islands, Campbell Islands, and the Otago Peninsula.

From a distance, the yellow-eyed penguin looks a bit like the gentoo, thanks to the yellow band that wraps around its head. However, the two species don't overlap in range, so they're impossible to misidentify in the wild.

The yellow-eyed penguin is listed as endangered with a decreasing population. There are fewer than 3,000-4,000 mature individuals left in the wild, making it one of the rarest penguin species. Its primary threats include disease, habitat degradation, introduced predators, and the impacts of climate change.
